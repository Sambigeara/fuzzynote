Two scenarios
add search group of any length
tab to create a new search group, add any number of chars

THEN EITHER
left key back to x position immediately after first search group
enter another key
char copies to next search group unexpectedly

OR
go to position 0
enter another key
it copies final character to next search group

BOTH SCENARIOS
final char of first search group regardless of length bumps to next search group under any circumstance

THEORY
Adding a char to the initial search group shifts the final char off into the first char of the subsequent one. This happens even if you're appending a char to the end of the first search group

Only problem is it's not always the case lol
